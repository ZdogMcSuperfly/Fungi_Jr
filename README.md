# Fungi Jr.
A clone of GBA DKjr. for the Arduboy. Made in one mammoth 12 hour sitting. 

(I'm going to bed now; Documentation later.)

Shoutout to Kenney for great CC0 assets. https://www.kenney.nl/assets/micro-roguelike

## Update 1
Added a win condition, overflow the score counter to see the little reward.

Fixed some bugs

## Known Bugs
Sometimes the score stops drawing most likely as a resault of the animation plays when points are scored. (no consitant replication)

Sometimes the score gives too little or too many points most likely cause of the water tank emptying animation. (no consitant replication)
